## Tips for Best Results

### üéØ Be Specific
Instead of: "A dog"
Try: "A golden retriever running through a sunlit meadow in slow motion, tail wagging, joyful expression"

### üí° Include Details
- **Lighting**: golden hour, dramatic, soft, natural
- **Camera**: close-up, wide shot, tracking, static
- **Mood**: peaceful, energetic, mysterious, dramatic
- **Environment**: detailed setting descriptions

### üí∞ Start Small
- Test with 5-10 second clips first
- Use Sora 2 (not Pro) for testing
- Switch to Standard quality for drafts
- Only use Pro + High Quality for finals

### üì± Match Your Platform

**TikTok/Reels:**
- Aspect Ratio: 9:16
- Duration: 10-15 seconds
- Fast-paced, engaging content

**YouTube:**
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Vague prompts** ‚Üí Be specific about what you want
‚ùå **Too long on first try** ‚Üí Start with 5-10 seconds
‚ùå **Forgetting lighting** ‚Üí Always describe the lighting
‚ùå **No camera movement** ‚Üí Mention static/pan/zoom/tracking
‚ùå **Using Pro for tests** ‚Üí Use standard Sora 2 first

## Cost Optimization

1. **Test Cheap**: Use Sora 2 + Standard + 5-10 seconds
2. **Iterate**: Refine your prompt with short clips
3. **Go Premium**: Only use Pro + High when you have the perfect prompt
4. **Batch Generate**: Generate multiple variations at once

## Prompt Formula

```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Lighting] + [Camera] + [Style/Mood]
```

**Example:**
```
A lone astronaut [subject]
floating in space [action]
above planet Earth [setting]
illuminated by the sun [lighting]
slow rotating camera [camera]
dramatic and awe-inspiring [mood]
```

**Result:** "A lone astronaut floating in space above planet Earth, illuminated by the sun, slow rotating camera, dramatic and awe-inspiring atmosphere"
